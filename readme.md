**llama-store** is a Typescript library for interacting with browser storage.
It makes it easy to store large objects into localStorage, and lets you so you can make small changes quickly. The restored objects are much more accurate copies of the saved ones and the API is incredibly simple. E.g.:

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install foobar.

```bash
npm install llama-store
```

## Usage

```typescript
import LlamaStore from 'llama-store';

interface MyAppStore extends Record<string, any> {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

// Using localStorage
const store = new LlamaStore<MyAppStore>('storeName');
```

### Events

> These are a work in progress

```typescript
// Write your event handler
const handleStoreSetupSuccess = (storeName: string) => {
    console.log(`[LlamaStore] []${storeName}`);

const storeConfig = {
    onStoreSetupSuccess: handleStoreSetupSuccess,
};
var messageStore = LlamaStore.persistent('messageStore', storeConfig);
```
